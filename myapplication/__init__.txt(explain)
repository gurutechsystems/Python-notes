The "__init__.py" in any is used to mark a directory as a python package
When a package is imported,python looks for the __init__.py file in the package directory and executes any code in it

__init__.py is also used to initialize tasks or set up the package namespace


We create an empty __init__.py in all directories in a python project to make the directories python packages.
This enables us to import modules in this directories into our python project
