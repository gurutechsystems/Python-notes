1==>Function: 
Functions enable use to modularize our code hence, we can reuse our code.It is a block of code that perform
specific tasks.Functions takes parameters and print message and defined using "def"

def hello():
    print('hello Ngembane, welcome to USA')

2==>Method:
This is a Function associated with a class(object). 

class lexicon():
    def __init__(self, name, description):
        self.name=name
        self.description=description
        self.paths={}

    def go(self, direction):
        return self.paths.get(direction,None)

In summary, while both functions and methods are used to perform a specific task, 
a method is a function that is associated with an object or a class, 
while a function can be called from anywhere in the code.
